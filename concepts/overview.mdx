Pragmatiks manages data infrastructure through three core concepts: **resources**, **providers**, and **dependencies**.

## Resources

A resource represents something you want to manage—a storage bucket, a dataset, or a service account. You define resources in YAML:

```yaml
provider: gcp
resource: bigquery-dataset
name: analytics
config:
  location: EU
```

Resources have a lifecycle: they're created, updated, and deleted based on your configuration.

## Providers

Providers are the bridge between Pragmatiks and external tools. Each provider knows how to manage specific resource types:

- **GCP provider**: Manages storage buckets, BigQuery datasets
- **Pragma provider**: Manages secrets and platform resources

## Dependencies

Resources can depend on other resources. Pragmatiks ensures dependencies are ready before processing dependent resources:

```yaml
provider: gcp
resource: bigquery-dataset
name: analytics
depends_on:
  - gcp/storage/data-lake
```
