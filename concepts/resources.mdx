A resource represents a managed object in an external tool—a Snowflake warehouse, a dbt model, an Airbyte connection.

## Resource Identity

Every resource has a unique identity:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `provider` | The provider that manages this resource | `snowflake` |
| `resource` | The type of resource | `warehouse` |
| `name` | A unique name you assign | `analytics-wh` |

## Lifecycle States

Resources move through these states:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **DRAFT** | Saved but not submitted for processing |
| **PENDING** | Queued for processing |
| **PROCESSING** | Currently being processed |
| **READY** | Successfully processed |
| **FAILED** | Processing failed |

## Configuration and Outputs

Resources have configuration (what you define) and outputs (what providers produce):

```yaml
# You define this
provider: snowflake
resource: warehouse
name: analytics-wh
config:
  size: MEDIUM
  auto_suspend: 300

# Provider produces outputs after processing
# outputs:
#   warehouse_url: "..."
#   created_at: "..."
```

## Applying Resources

By default, resources are created in DRAFT state:

```bash
pragma resources apply warehouse.yaml
```

To queue for immediate processing:

```bash
pragma resources apply --pending warehouse.yaml
```
