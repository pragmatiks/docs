Providers are the bridge between Pragmatiks and external tools. Each provider knows how to create, update, and delete specific resource types.

## What Providers Do

1. **Register resource types** they can manage
2. **Process lifecycle events** when resources are created, updated, or deleted
3. **Report results** back to the platform

## Available Providers

| Provider | Resources |
|----------|-----------|
| GCP | Storage buckets, BigQuery datasets |
| Pragma | Secrets, platform resources |

## Provider Configuration

Some providers require credentials or configuration. Use secrets to store sensitive values:

```yaml
provider: pragma
resource: secret
name: gcp-credentials
config:
  data:
    project_id: "my-project"
    service_account_key: "..."
```

## Building Custom Providers

You can build providers for any tool. See the Building Providers guide for details.
